These pandas notes were prepared while learning data analysis concepts hands-on, using multiple different datasets instead of a single sample file.

Each topic is practiced with realistic datasets to understand:

When to use a concept
Why it is needed
How it behaves with real data
The notes cover beginner to intermediate pandas concepts with practical examples
